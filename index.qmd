The **Climate and Enteric Diseases Research Project**, or **ClimED**, is an international collaborative research project aimed at generating robust scientific evidence on the impacts of climate change on enteric diseases, also known as diarrheal diseases. ClimED members are scientists and experts from various fields of health and environmental sciences, and each has provided enteric disease data. ClimED features a compilation of reported enteric disease cases from various health datasets (i.e., vital statistics records, surveillance systems, health insurance databases, among others) across multiple countries, coupled with climate-related exposures extracted from open-source datasets available at the subnational level. ClimED researchers employ advanced statistical techniques to disentangle the association between diarrheal diseases and various climate exposures, including ambient temperature, precipitation, tropical cyclones, and flooding. ClimED also aims to support mitigation and adaptation by estimating climate change-related diarrheal disease cases both historically and in the future, based on established socioeconomic and climate scenarios. [ClimED is coordinated and managed by Professor Masahiro Hashizume and his team at the Department of Global Health Policy, Graduate School of Medicine, the University of Tokyo.]{.underline}

ClimED is open to new members (i.e., those providing data on diarrheal diseases) and research collaborations. For non-members, raw or processed datasets can be requested from each data provider on a project-by-project or study-by-study basis. Studies beyond climate change are also welcome.
